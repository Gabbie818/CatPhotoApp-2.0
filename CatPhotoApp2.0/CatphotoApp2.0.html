    <h2>All About Cats</h2>
    <p>"The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal" (). It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>

    <h2>Three Things That Cats Love</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Eating, treats, and Food on a set schedule</em></li>
        <li><em>Sleeping and Power Naps</em></li>
        <li><em>Playing and daily Playtime</em></li>
    </ol>
<h3>Eating, treats, and Food on a set schedule</h3>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.be6b50ca3c84cf006d03c4f234906c1b?rik=qYTK5ya8MzZSKQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.whycatwhy.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f01%2ftwo-cats-eating-food-e1456359051873.jpg&ehk=DvExL4rGo107Q3DAvaXkRwF1GazXqNYeMyGqONiHW2M%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" width="540" alt="cats eating">
<p>Cats truly love and adore food. More finicky cats will demand fresh food that is newly opened and then won't touch it after that. Cats should be fed on a daily schedule and they do keep to a schedule.  Some folks do not even need an alarm clock, as their cat will let them know when it is time to be fed.</p>
<h3>Sleeping and power Naps</h3>
<img src=https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.QaXZX2J9cHcglL0Gp3JWfgHaEo?pidImgDet&rs1 width="540" alt="Cats sleeping">
<p>Cats sleep on average 15-16 hours per day and they love their cat naps.</p>
<h3>Playing and daily playtime</h3>
<img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.20a9600da3e5cd861e7f9b72efce5578?rik=ArWGM906dx2dPQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.zastavki.com%2fpictures%2f1600x1200%2f2009%2fAnimals_Cats_Playing_Kitten_015901_.jpg&ehk=2J%2b%2bR%2fuVYpGID0FdfHHaUwLoNcFpv7OrlY3D5ez5cWc%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" width="540" alt="kittens playing">
<p>Cats love their toys and many common household items like bottle tabs, rubber bands, crinkly bags, straws, string, or wine corks will work just fine for one element of playtime.  Cats also like interactive play, so chasing the laser dot and interactive cat wand toys are great ways to provide interactive play time.  Some cat breeds even enjoy playing fetch.</p>

    <h2>Three Things That Cats Hate</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><em>Loud noises</em></li>
        <li><em> Dirty Litter Box</em></li>
        <li><em>Change</em></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Loud Noises</h3>
    <img src="https://tippvet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/bigstock-Sad-Gray-Cat-In-Hands-384055502-cropped.jpg" width="540" alt="Cat experiencing loud noises">
    <p>Loud noises make cats very nervous for very good reasons: in nature, loud noises can indicate a dangerous predator that could potentially ruin a cat’s day. When a cat hears a loud noise it activates the part of their brain that governs the fight, flight, or freeze response.</p>
    <h3>Dirty Litter Box</h3>
    <img src="https://herekitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/A-dirty-litter-box.jpg" width="540" alt="Dirty litter box">
    <p>Dirty or crowded litterboxes can lead to stress in cats, which can manifest as inappropriate elimination, i.e. urinating and/or defecating outside the litterbox, probably where you don’t want them to go.</p>
    <h3>Change</h3>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.a1a95d365b9dbcef1b5742175b89c690?rik=Ja03Nuz1Vdvm1g&riu=http%3a%2f%2fwww.healthypawspetinsurance.com%2fblog%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fCat-Licking-Paw.jpg&ehk=3OfgnekwvLxlRXYa29399aMWVGb1LyaBX%2fzDcmdGtwM%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" width="540" alt="Cat licking paw">
    <p>Cats are like humans in one way: they don't like change. They like routine, they like the same food, the same treats, the same people and pets in their environment. Some cats can become very stressed when you have visitors in your home, during renovation, when you change their food, litter types, box locations, etc.</p>

    <h2>Cat Form</h2>
    <form>
        <h3>Indoor or Outdoor</h3>
        <fieldset class="center">
            <legend class="center">Is your cat an indoor or outdoor cat?</legend>
           <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" id="Indoor" value="Indoor">Indoor</input></label>
           <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" id="Outdoor" value="Outdoor">Outdoor</input></label> 
        </fieldset>
        <p>Indoor cats tend to live longer than their outdoor counterparts, typically reaching 10 to 15 years of age. Cats who spend their lives exclusively outdoors live an average of just 2 to 5 years.</p>
        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <fieldset class="center">
            <legend>What is your cats personality</legend>
            <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" id="loving" value="loving">Loving</label>
            <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" id="lazy" value="lazy">Lazy</label>
            <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" id="energetic" value="energetic">Energetic</label>

            <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" id="curious" value="curious">Curious</label>
         </fieldset>
         <p>If you've known more than one cat in your lifetime, you know that each cat is unique, with her own personality. Behaviorists have been working on ways to categorize feline personalities, usually with the goal of matching up cats with families (both human and feline) where they will best fit in</p>
         <h3>Sleep</h3>
         <fieldset class="center">
            <legend>Does your cat sleep a lot?</legend>
            <label><input type="radio" name="sleep" id="yes" value="yes">Yes</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="sleep" id="somewhat" value="somewhat" >Somewhat</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="sleep" id="no" value="no">No</label>
         </fieldset>
         <p>Cats have a polyphasic sleep pattern, which means they sleep multiple times each day rather than in one, long period, like humans generally sleep.</p>
         <h3>Coloring</h3>
         <fieldset class="center">
            <legend>Is your cat more than one color?</legend>
            <label><input type="radio" name="color" id="yes" value="yes">Yes</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="color" id="no" value="no">No</label>
         </fieldset>
         <p>The differences and variety that comes with cat coats are one of the features that make each cat different. The different cat colors on display worldwide can be attributed to a several reasons, including genetics, and so can the patterns.</p>
